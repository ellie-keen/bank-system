## Bank Tech Test

This is a mock tech test issued by Makers Academy. The task is to be able to interact with out code via a REPL. I have chosen to use the language Ruby and to interact with my project using IRB. The requirements are to be able to deposit and withdraw money from a bank account and display a bank balance with the correct amount and dates. 

It is an application written using test driven development.
